# Olist Customer Satisfaction Analysis: A Case Study

## 1. Introduction & Background

### Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset by Olist. The primary objective is to identify the key drivers of negative customer reviews and provide actionable recommendations to the Olist Operations & Strategy Team. By examining the entire order lifecycle—from purchase to delivery and subsequent review—this analysis aims to uncover insights that can help improve customer satisfaction, reduce churn, and foster long-term growth.

### Olist: The Business Context
Olist is a major player in the Brazilian e-commerce market, but it operates with a unique business model. It is not a direct retailer but a **marketplace integrator**, or a "store of stores." Olist's core mission is to empower small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) by providing them with a platform to sell their products on Brazil's largest marketplaces, such as Mercado Livre, Americanas, and Amazon Brazil.

Essentially, Olist acts as a bridge, offering its sellers a suite of solutions including:
* **Centralized Store Management:** A single dashboard to manage products, orders, and inventory across multiple sales channels.
* **Logistics & Fulfillment:** Streamlining the complex shipping and delivery process across the vast geography of Brazil.
* **Customer Service & Payments:** Handling customer interactions and financial transactions.

### The Challenge: Customer Satisfaction in a Complex Market
The Brazilian e-commerce landscape is one of the fastest-growing in the world, but it is also fraught with challenges, most notably in logistics. For Olist, which represents thousands of different sellers, ensuring a consistent and positive customer experience is a monumental task. Since customers often see Olist as the seller of record, any issue—be it a shipping delay, a problem with the product, or poor communication—reflects directly on the Olist brand.

In a market where consumer trust is paramount and online reviews carry significant weight, maintaining high customer satisfaction is not just a goal; it is a critical driver of business success. This case study tackles this challenge head-on by using data to understand and address the root causes of customer dissatisfaction.
