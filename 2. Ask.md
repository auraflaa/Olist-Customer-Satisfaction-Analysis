### The Business Task
The core of this project is to address a critical business challenge identified by Olist's leadership: a concerning trend of rising negative customer reviews, which poses a direct threat to customer retention and long-term growth. The central business task is to move from anecdotal evidence to data-driven facts to answer the question:

**"What are the key drivers of negative customer reviews, and how can we use these insights to improve the overall customer experience?"**

### Project Objectives
The primary goal is to deliver a clear, concise, and actionable analysis to the Operations & Strategy Team. Success for this project is defined by achieving the following objectives:

1.  **Identify Root Causes:** Pinpoint the top 2-3 operational factors that show the strongest correlation with negative review scores (1 and 2 stars).
2.  **Quantify the Impact:** Measure the specific impact of these factors. For example, quantify how a delay in shipping translates to a quantifiable drop in customer satisfaction scores.
3.  **Deliver Actionable Recommendations:** Formulate data-supported recommendations that the strategy team can use to guide operational improvements, enhance seller support programs, and set more accurate customer expectations.

### Guiding Analytical Questions
To structure the analysis and ensure it directly addresses the business task, the following guiding questions will be investigated:

* **Delivery Performance vs. Satisfaction:** How does the actual delivery time compared to the estimated delivery time impact customer review scores?
* **Product Category Impact:** Are there specific product categories that consistently receive lower review scores, suggesting issues with product quality or misrepresentation?
* **Geographic Seller Performance:** Do sellers from certain geographic regions have a higher rate of negative reviews or shipping delays, indicating localized operational challenges?

### Key Stakeholders
The insights from this analysis are intended for key decision-makers within Olist who are responsible for the health of the marketplace.

* **Primary Stakeholders:** The **Head of Strategy** and the **Operations & Strategy Team**. They will use these findings to shape high-level strategy and drive implementation.
* **Secondary Stakeholders:** The **Seller Relationship Team** (to improve seller onboarding and training), the **Logistics Team** (specifically Olist Pax, to optimize shipping routes and carrier performance), and the **Product Team** (to improve the customer feedback loop).
