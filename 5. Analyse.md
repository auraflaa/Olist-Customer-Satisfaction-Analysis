# 5. Analyze

### Key Findings & Insights
The analysis of the cleaned and processed data revealed clear, actionable insights that directly answer the guiding questions of the case study. The findings are summarized below and presented in detail in the visualizations that follow.

1.  **Late Delivery is a Major Driver of Negative Reviews:** The data shows an undeniable correlation between delivery delays and review scores. While it's not the only factor, a late delivery significantly increases the likelihood of a negative review.

2.  **Certain Product Categories Consistently Underperform:** The analysis also identified a small number of product categories that have a disproportionately high rate of negative reviews, suggesting issues beyond just shipping, such as product quality or inaccurate descriptions.

3.  **Geographic Disparities in Seller Performance:** Seller performance is not uniform across Brazil. While the map shows a general concentration of issues in the southeast, a deeper look at the data reveals that some smaller states have critically low average review scores.

### R Visualizations & Scripts

The findings of this analysis were visualized using R with the `ggplot2` library. The scripts used to generate each visualization are provided below for full transparency and reproducibility.

#### Finding 1: Delivery Delays vs. Review Scores
This density plot reveals a crucial insight. As expected, there is a large peak of negative reviews for orders that were delivered late (right of the dashed line). However, there is also a significant peak of negative reviews for orders that were delivered early or on time. This indicates that **while late delivery is a major cause of dissatisfaction, it is not the only cause.** Other factors, such as product quality, are also at play.

       aes(x = delivery_diff_days, fill = review_category, color = review_category)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Delivery Delay Profiles for Positive vs. Negative Reviews",
       x = "Delivery Delay (Days)",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()
```

For a more granular view, the scatter plot below confirms that when a delivery is late, there is a very high concentration of negative reviews (red dots). This reinforces that while not all negative reviews are due to delays, a delayed order is highly likely to result in a negative review.

#### Finding 2: Problem Product Categories
This bar chart highlights the top 20 product categories with the highest percentage of negative reviews, allowing for easy identification of problem areas that may require further investigation into product quality or seller practices.

#### Finding 3: Geographic Hotspots
This map of Brazil visualizes the rate of negative reviews by seller location. While no single state is exclusively negative or positive, the map shows a clear concentration of issues in the southeastern region. However, a deeper look at the aggregated data reveals that some states with fewer reviews, like **Acre (AC)** and **Amazonas (AM)**, have critically low average review scores, indicating severe localized problems that may be hidden in a broader view.
