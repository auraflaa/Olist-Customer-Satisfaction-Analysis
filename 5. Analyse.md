### Key Findings & Insights
The analysis of the cleaned and processed data revealed clear, actionable insights that directly answer the guiding questions of the case study. The findings are summarized below and presented in detail in the visualizations that follow.

1.  **Late Delivery is the Primary Driver of Negative Reviews:** The data shows an undeniable correlation between delivery delays and review scores. The longer an order is delayed past its estimated delivery date, the higher the probability of receiving a negative review.

2.  **Certain Product Categories Consistently Underperform:** While delivery time is a major factor, the analysis also identified a small number of product categories that have a disproportionately high rate of negative reviews, suggesting issues beyond just shipping.

3.  **Geographic Disparities in Seller Performance:** Seller performance is not uniform across Brazil. Sellers located in specific states have a significantly higher rate of negative reviews, pointing to regional operational challenges.

### R Visualizations & Scripts

The findings of this analysis were visualized using R with the `ggplot2` library. The scripts used to generate each visualization are provided below for full transparency and reproducibility.

#### Finding 1: Delivery Delays vs. Review Scores
This density plot clearly shows that the distribution for positive reviews peaks when deliveries are early (left of the dashed line), while the distribution for negative reviews peaks when deliveries are late (right of the dashed line). This is the strongest evidence that meeting and beating delivery estimates is critical for customer satisfaction.
