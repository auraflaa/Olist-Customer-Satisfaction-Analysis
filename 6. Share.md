### Final Deliverables
The insights from this analysis were consolidated into two key deliverables designed for different audiences: a comprehensive, reproducible report for a technical audience, and an interactive dashboard for business stakeholders.

1.  **Hosted R Markdown Report (`index.html`)**
    This is the primary deliverable of the project. The R Markdown file was rendered into a self-contained HTML report that details the entire analytical process, from the business problem to the final recommendations. It includes all the R code and visualizations, ensuring the analysis is fully transparent and reproducible.

2.  **Interactive Tableau Dashboard**
    An interactive dashboard was created in Tableau Public to allow for a more exploratory, high-level view of the findings. This dashboard is designed for business stakeholders who want to interact with the data directly.

### Summary of Key Findings

The analysis and visualizations clearly demonstrate that:

* **Late Delivery is the Primary Driver of Negative Reviews:** There is a strong, direct correlation between delivery delays and negative customer reviews.
* **Product Quality is a Secondary Factor:** Even when orders are on time, certain product categories consistently receive poor reviews, indicating issues with product quality or damage.
* **Seller Performance is Geographically Concentrated:** The data reveals geographic "hotspots" where sellers have higher rates of negative reviews, pointing to regional operational challenges.

This GitHub repository serves as the central hub for the project, containing all data processing scripts, the R Markdown source code, and links to the final, shareable artifacts.
