# 7. Act

Based on the data-driven findings from the analysis, the following three actionable recommendations are proposed to the Olist Operations & Strategy Team. These recommendations are designed to directly address the key drivers of negative reviews and improve overall customer satisfaction.

### Recommendation 1: Launch a Tiered Seller Performance Program Focused on Shipping Speed.

* **What:** Implement a program that identifies, rewards, and supports sellers who consistently ship orders quickly, while also creating a clear path for improvement for underperforming sellers.
* **Why:** The data proves that shipping delays are the single biggest driver of customer dissatisfaction. By incentivizing sellers to reduce their `seller_processing_days`, Olist can directly address the root cause of many negative reviews and improve the customer experience at scale.
* **How:**
    1.  **Establish KPIs:** Define clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for seller processing time (e.g., "Good" = ship within 24 hours, "Acceptable" = 24-48 hours, "Poor" = >48 hours).
    2.  **Offer Incentives:** Provide tangible benefits for top-tier sellers, such as reduced commission rates, "fast shipper" badges on product listings to increase sales, or priority support.
    3.  **Implement a Warning System:** For sellers who consistently fall into the "Poor" category, implement a tiered warning system. This could start with automated notifications and required training modules, and escalate to temporary account suspension if performance does not improve.

### Recommendation 2: Conduct a Targeted Quality Audit on the Lowest-Performing Product Categories.

* **What:** Initiate a targeted review of the top 3-5 product categories that have the highest rates of negative reviews, such as "security_and_services".
* **Why:** The analysis shows that these categories underperform even when delivery times are accounted for. This strongly suggests deeper issues with product quality, authenticity, damage during transit, or inaccurate product descriptions, which directly erode customer trust.
* **How:**
    1.  **Partner with the Seller Team:** The Operations team should work with the Seller Relationship team to investigate the top sellers in these problematic categories.
    2.  **Review Product Listings:** Audit the product descriptions and images for accuracy and clarity.
    3.  **Update Guidelines:** Consider implementing stricter listing guidelines or mandatory packaging requirements for these specific product categories to prevent common issues.

### Recommendation 3: Optimize Logistics Partnerships in Underperforming Geographic Regions.

* **What:** Re-evaluate and optimize logistics and carrier partnerships in the states identified as geographic "hotspots" with the highest rates of negative reviews and delivery delays.
* **Why:** The geographic analysis indicates that systemic, regional issues are at play, likely related to the performance of specific logistics carriers in those areas rather than just individual seller performance.
* **How:**
    1.  **Share Data with Carriers:** Use the performance data from this analysis to hold current logistics partners accountable in these specific regions.
    2.  **Explore New Partnerships:** Actively seek out and pilot new, local logistics providers who may offer more reliable or faster service in these identified states.
    3.  **Adjust Delivery Estimates:** In the short term, use the data to adjust the estimated delivery dates for these regions to be more realistic. Managing customer expectations can significantly reduce dissatisfaction from perceived delays, even if the actual shipping time remains the same.
