# Case Study: How Can an E-commerce Store Convert One-Time Buyers into Loyal Customers?

### 1. Introduction

Welcome to the StyleSpire sales analysis case study. In this project, you will act as a Junior Data Analyst for **StyleSpire**, a fictional e-commerce company. Your mission is to analyze customer purchasing behavior to drive key business decisions. To answer the key business questions, you will follow the six steps of the data analysis process: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act**. The provided roadmaps will help guide you through each phase of the project.

### 2. Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analytics team at StyleSpire, an online retailer of modern apparel and accessories. The Director of Marketing is convinced that the company's long-term profitability hinges on increasing customer loyalty and retention. Therefore, your team's primary goal is to understand the differences in purchasing behavior between **one-time buyers** and **repeat customers**. With these insights, the team will develop a new, targeted marketing strategy aimed at converting one-time buyers into valuable repeat customers. Your analysis and recommendations must be supported by clear data visualizations and compelling insights to gain approval from the executive team.

### 3. Characters and Teams
* **StyleSpire**: A growing e-commerce company that offers a wide range of trendy apparel, shoes, and accessories. It has a significant customer base across several countries but wants to improve its customer retention rate.
* **Isabella Rossi**: The Director of Marketing and your manager. She is focused on developing data-driven campaigns that increase customer lifetime value (CLV) and foster brand loyalty.
* **Marketing Analytics Team**: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting on sales and customer data to guide marketing strategy. You are a new member of this team.
* **Executive Team**: The detail-oriented executive team that will review your findings and decide whether to approve the new marketing program.

### 4. About the Company

Founded in 2018, StyleSpire has grown into a popular e-commerce platform with a large catalog of products. The company’s marketing strategy has so far focused on broad customer acquisition through social media and general online advertising.

Customers are currently categorized into two simple groups: **one-time buyers** (customers who have made only one purchase) and **repeat customers** (customers who have made two or more purchases).

StyleSpire’s finance analysts recently concluded that repeat customers are far more profitable for the business, as their average order value and lifetime value are significantly higher than those of one-time buyers. While the current strategy attracts many new customers, Isabella Rossi believes that a focused effort to convert one-time buyers is the key to sustainable growth. She notes that these customers are already familiar with the brand and have shown interest by making an initial purchase.

Rossi has set a clear goal: **Design marketing strategies aimed at converting one-time buyers into repeat customers**. To do this, the team needs to analyze historical sales data to understand how these customer groups differ.

### **Ask**

Three questions guide this marketing initiative:
1.  How do one-time buyers and repeat customers differ in their purchasing behaviors?
2.  What factors might motivate a one-time buyer to make a second purchase?
3.  How can StyleSpire leverage digital media and promotions to encourage repeat purchases?

Isabella Rossi has assigned you the first question to answer: **How do one-time buyers and repeat customers differ in their purchasing behaviors?**

You will produce a report with the following deliverables:
1.  A clear statement of the business task
2.  A description of all data sources used
3.  Documentation of any data cleaning or manipulation
4.  A summary of your analysis
5.  Supporting visualizations and key findings
6.  Your top three recommendations based on your analysis

### **Prepare**

For this project, you will use a public dataset that mirrors real-world e-commerce transactions. A highly recommended dataset is the **Online Retail II Data Set** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains transactional data from a UK-based online retailer.

(Note: This public dataset will serve as a proxy for StyleSpire's internal data. For this case study, it is appropriate and will allow you to answer the business questions. Due to data privacy policies, you cannot use personally identifiable information to connect purchases directly to individuals.)

### **Analyze**

Now that your data is stored and prepared, start your analysis. Your goal is to identify the key differences between one-time buyers and repeat customers.

**Some suggested calculations include:**
* Calculate the total price for each transaction line.
* Aggregate data by customer to identify one-time vs. repeat buyers.
* Conduct descriptive analysis of each group:
    * Average Order Value (AOV).
    * Average number of items per order.
    * Most frequently purchased products or product categories.
    * Sales distribution by country.
* Analyze purchasing patterns by day of the week or month to find trends.
* Create pivot tables to compare metrics between the two customer groups.
